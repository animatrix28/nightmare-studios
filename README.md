This game introduces an innovative approach where screen orientation flips which changes the gravity of obstacles and players. The player can move left and right using the left/A and right/D keys respectively. Player has to avoid obstacles or use them to clear the level. They also have to avoid spikes which are in red color to avoid instant death. Orientation of the play area changes using the ‘f’ key. When pressed, the play area will rotate clockwise and the gravity of the obstacles and player will change respectively.
